Explain the following Linux commands with an example.


1.	Pwd: The pwd (print working directory) command displays the name of the current working directory. 

 







2.	vi:  Vi is a text editor that allows a user to control the system by solely using the keyboard instead of a combination of mouse selections and keystrokes.

  









3.	Touch: The touch command is the easiest way to create new, empty files. It is also used to change the timestamps (i.e., dates and times of the most recent access and modification) on existing files and directories.

 





	


4.	Mkdir: The mkdir command creates a single directories or multiple directories.

 





	





5.	rm:  This manual page documents the GNU version of rm. rm removes each specified file. By default, it does not remove directories. If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are more than three files or the -r, -R, or --recursive are given, then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation. If the response is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted. 

Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or the -i or --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file. If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped.

 



	
6.	Is: List information about the FILEs (the current directory by default). Sort entries alphabetically if none of -cftuvSUX nor --sort is specified.
Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
 







	

7.	Echo: Echo allows a user to repeat, or "echo," a string variable to standard output.

 









8.	Cat: A Unix/Linux command that can read, modify or concatenate text files. Cat commands are most commonly used for displaying the contents of a file. 

 




	




9.	Who: Display who is on the system.

 









	

10.	cd: The cd command changes the current directory in Linux and can toggle between directories conveniently. Cd is similar to the CD and CHDIR commands in MS-DOS.

 






	


11.	date: Date sets a system's date and time. This is also a useful way to output/print current information when working in a script file.

 





	




12.	Cal: Display a conveniently-formatted calendar from the command line. 

 










13.	mv: move (rename) files

 











14.	cp: copy files and directories

 









	

15.	Which: locate a command
